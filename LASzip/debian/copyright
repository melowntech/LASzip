Comment: From the FastAC header:
 .
  The only purpose of this program is to demonstrate the basic principles
  of arithmetic coding. The original version of this code can be found in
  Digital Signal Compression: Principles and Practice
  (Cambridge University Press, 2011, ISBN: 9780511984655)
 .
  A description of the arithmetic coding method used here is available in
 .
  Lossless Compression Handbook, ed. K. Sayood
  Chapter 5: Arithmetic Coding (A. Said), pp. 101-152, Academic Press, 2003
